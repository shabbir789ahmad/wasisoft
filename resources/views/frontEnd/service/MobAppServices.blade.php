                        <p>A native application is a mobile application that is developed directly for an operating system (Android, iOS, etc). This application is generally built in the language specific to the system.</p>

                        <p>The mobile web application is a thin client. Long neglected in favor of the native application, it is back in force with the development of HTML5 and CSS3 standards which will improve the user experience and offer more richness
